inTouch is an Android Mobile Application that helps different people stay connected. With a click of a button, the user
can swap contact information in the form of name, phone number, and email with another individual by pulling from a 
contact repository. We hope to save people's time when swapping phone numbers with new people for business or for personal
reasons. You can use the application is any setting, customized to the need of the business or personal use.
